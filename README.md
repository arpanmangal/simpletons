# Disaster Repulsion

## Idea

A quick, easy and effective escape route is the primary requirement of people stuck in the middle of disaster. So is the ability to alert fellow people about possible danger areas and the ability to call for instant and effective help which could reach you easily.

Our idea focus on making a mobile application which people, stuck in disaster, could use to figure out possible safe paths out and that too quickly without hassle. It would also act as a medium to call for quick effective help for oneself or for fellow mates.

The application will basically consist of a map of the locality with danger areas marked appropriately. (Danger areas are the real time _'not safe'_ areas during the disaster whose method of identification is described in following paragraph.) People will be shown the safest and quickest way of exit (going far from the danger area) from their present position. This functionality will be available in two ways. One is the usual way representation in Bing Maps or Google Maps. The problem with the way of their information representation is that it is slow to process and consume (due to the processing time to figure out the correpondance between depicted path and real available paths and surrondings) and also draws away people's attention away from the real surroundings (which may not be a good idea if everything around is changing dynamically and you need to be remain on continuous gaurd). So we add the function of augmented help, which using Augmented Reality (AR) technology, will direct people the safest path in a way as simple as putting a danger sign (like skull and crossbones) in the direction of danger path in their camera feed, or putting a safe sign when they turn their mobile in a direction which is safe to go. It will the safest and quickest way of escape and people just have to follow the safe sign displayed on their real camera feed removing the hazzle of finding corresponding paths or treading cautiously.

The danger zones could be identified in two major ways. One way (which is more possible in developed countries) is the use of drones by government or military to identify and update the danger zones of the locality during the disaster. But this may not be the quickest and most reliable way of going about it. We propose to do it the collaborative way where people in the disaster scene may annotate the location they are currently on in terms of danger level. This will help other people identify that location as safe or danger according to the annotation and follow appropriate path.

In a similar way people could mark their current location as a location where they themselves or some other guy is in need of help, and this information depicted in the form of a heatmap over the map of the locality will help the rescue team figure out quickly regions where people are stuck and in need of help. The app will also assist the rescue team to figure out the safest and quickest path to reach the needy while avoiding the dangers.

## Main Features
1. Augmented reality application to guide people to safe spots during the incidence of a disaster and help the rescue team to reach the needy, by appropriately annotating a location as danger or help needed.
2. Provision of people to annotate a location as danger or help needed resulting in collaborative and coordinated efforts to save one and all.
3. Visualisation of the region in terms of danger zones and help needy areas.

## Technologies
1. Android
2. Azure Cloud
3. An augmented reality SDK
